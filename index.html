        <p>

          Hello, my name is Ross Reicks and I'm a Junior Software Developer at John Deere.

          In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new web technologies, riding my bicycle, and playing video games.

          <br>

          <br>

          I have worked on many projects in my past to try out new technologies and keep me fresh. I spend a lot of my time with my head in the AWS cloud, pun intended.
          
          Some of my projects are listed below.

          In the summer of 2016, I started a tech summer camp for high school students to learn programming before college. I called it Coding In Carroll.

          <h2>Dance Party</h2>

          <p>

            In the summer of 2020, I spent a couple days of my quarantine building an application that allows someone to setup their own virtual jukebox. 
            
            The goals of the application were to try out github CI/CD, play with AWS serverless, and see how websockets work in API gateway.
            
            The application interacts with the Spotify API and allows 1 user to setup their jukebox and send the link to others for them to add song to the queue.
            
            This is no longer deployed due to monetary constraints. Costs about $10 a month in AWS costs

          <p>

            In August 2016, I was invited to work on Thinix' iStatus Cloud Dashboard; an ASP.NET Enterprise Application that

            allows customers to view the status of their internet connections remotly. I have learned the ins and outs of building Restful APIs with C#

            and that Angular works great for large enterprise applications.

          <img src="" alt="">

          <p>

            My last semester of college my team and I built a remote control module that accepts commands from to the Amazon Alexa. Users can then tell their Echo to

            turn up or down their tv as well as request that it change the channel for them. No more need to worry about loosing the remote control or even about 

            getting off the couch to look for it. This was all created using custom built hardware as well as a 3D printed case. All the software was written in the 

            form of lambda functions, because that is just how the Alexa developer kit works.

          <p>

            In a class called "Software Project Management" I was required to form a team to create a software project as well as a handful of PM documents. 

            My team worked on an application the suggests movies to users at random based on their mood. We pull data from various websites including IMDB, Netflix, Hulu, 

            and Amazon. The project is written in ASP.NET with an Angular client.

          <p>

            DevChat is a personal project that I started in December of 2016 that is a self hosted chat client. The idea is based around the fact that Slack has been 

            hacked and company's data has been comprimised. To solve this issue, an alternative needs to be created. Most tech companies have some sort of in house web server 

            that they are able to host this application on. It is written in Node.js with an Angular client.

          <img src="./img/stalkerbot.png" style="width:90px;" alt="">

          <p>

            I took a software development class where we were tasked with forming a team and building a project throughout the semester.

            My team came up with the idea for Stalkerbot, an application that will pull data from social media accounts and send data to you via text message.

            You could choose who to stalk and on what interval you wanted it to send you information. This was built using ASP.NET Core utilizing Microsoft's bot

            framework.

          <p>

            Coding In Carroll was a summer tech camp I started in Carroll, Iowa. The school district's curriculum did not teach

            computer science classes so this camp let high school students experience programming before attending

            a university. Throughout the summer I coached 12 kids on the basics of programming and building software projects.

          <img src="" alt="">

          <p>

            In Spring 2016, I took an embedded systems class that tasked us with writing the software to create an autonomous robot. Given a robot with a handful of 

            sensors and an API document, a team of 4 engineering students had to create a program that allowed us to blindly navigate a robot through an obstical course. 

            We created a GUI that printed the values from the robot's sensor and used it to navigate around obsticles to find the maze's finish.

            Lotions and Lathers is a small buisness in Carroll, Iowa that sells handmade bath products. I developed a

            site using openCart which enabled the owner to sell her products online. The site has since been converted to a WIX site because it was easier for her to design herself.

            positions. One of those positions was entitled "Web Master". During my time as Adelante's Web Master, I completly redid

            the frontend and backend of the web site and built a slick CMS to allow for easy updating for new Web Masters.

        <h2>Skills</h2>

        <p>

          Studying as a computer engineer, I have learned all that you might think: Java Objects, Data Structures, Assembly Programming, etc.

          The time when I learn the most is when I'm freelancing and playing around with new technologies. I have built a custom CMS in php,

          developed my own IOS apps, designed my own openCart theme, played around with Laravel's MVC framework, and so much more.

          I consider myself a developer that is constantly learning new and exciting things. I love what I do, and I put passion in my work.
